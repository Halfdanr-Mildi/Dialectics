Haixiang: Psalm 23:23 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. Philippians 4:11 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. 12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. If we are to be content with what God has given us, should we still want and pursuit things in life: such as promotion, money, or romantic relationships?
