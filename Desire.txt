Haixiang: Psalm 23:23 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. Philippians 4:11 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. 12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. If we are to be content with what God has given us, should we still want and pursuit things in life: such as promotion, money, or romantic relationships?

JT: I think we should pursue those things if they glorify God.  With money and stuff, if you want to make more money to give to God or to take care of your family, then that's cool because you are trying to do things God wants you to do.  If you just want more money to use on yourself, then that's not good.  Same with romantic relationships.  If you think that relationship will help you glorify God more, then by all means you should do it.  Also, some people want to get married so they can have kids.  God also calls people to do that, so that seems fine (also, Paul gives the case about purity too.  Getting married can be a way to help with purity).
