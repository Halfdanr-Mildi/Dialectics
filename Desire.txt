Haixiang: Psalm 23:23 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. Philippians 4:11 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. 12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. If we are to be content with what God has given us, should we still want and pursuit things in life: such as promotion, money, or romantic relationships?

JT: I think we should pursue those things if they glorify God.  With money and stuff, if you want to make more money to give to God or to take care of your family, then that's cool because you are trying to do things God wants you to do.  If you just want more money to use on yourself, then that's not good.  Same with romantic relationships.  If you think that relationship will help you glorify God more, then by all means you should do it.  Also, some people want to get married so they can have kids.  God also calls people to do that, so that seems fine (also, Paul gives the case about purity too.  Getting married can be a way to help with purity).  

Haixiang: So those things can be glorify to God but given that we have not given explicit command to (for example, God does not tell us to make a lot of money, or to date people we like), but didn't it glorifies God more if we instead use our time and energy to do things God has commanded us? To serve the poor, to love everyone (not just the ones we like or the ones that loves us Mathew 5:46). Why should we make those things that we desire as priority in our life over other things God calls us to do?

JT: Those things shouldn't come at the cost of other things God asks us to do.  Like we shouldn't steal to get money for the church, but in our doing what God wants, we will find things we need to do that.  There's nothing wrong with trying to get those things.  If the church needed money for something important and I could get a job to make money for that, why not?  God also gives us many commands that are not explicit.  If we can't do stuff he doesn't explicitly tell us to do, we can't do hardly anything.  Even loving people.  It doesn't say what exactly we should do to love people, but we still have to find ways to do it.

Haixiang: So, regarding "Those things shouldn't come at the cost of other things God asks us to do". Even though we may not do what directly against what God calls us. In many cases, when we surrender our desire, we can give more to God. Money for example, indead, making more money allows us to give more to God, but if we only give 10% to God and keep 90% to ourself to get what we wants, by sacrifies our desire, couldn't we give more? In this sense, our desire seems to come at the cost of the things God asks as to do. Similiarly, when dating, we spend more time to love one person than love more people. Doesn't that come at the cost of that we are unable to love others more?

JT:  In the examples I gave, the desire to make the money was good, even if it's not explicitly commanded.  Obviously, if we want to make money for selfish gain, that's not okay.  Again, we can't disobey God to get the money we want unselfishly, but we can work on it if we want.  Even dating, if your motivation to have a girlfriend is Godly, what's wrong with puting in the effort to make that happen?  If I want to have a wife to help me grow and to learn from and to help me as I serve God, what's wrong with that, or even a wife to help me satisfy my lustful (if I'm not married) desires.  A similar example is what if someone is especially struggling with something and really, really needs someone to talk to.  Is it wrong to 'love them more than other people'?  You could say it's favoritism, but that person needs more love at that time.  Or even if someone asks you for help a lot..  Should you deny them the help because you don't want to spend more time helping them than other people?  Especially if there's nobody else that's actively even seeking that stuff out?

Haixiang: So, when we desire we commonly are want things for our own. If you can think of anyone always only want things for God, I certainly think they are noble person. And yet I knows no one only want things for God. Now, if we are talking about desiring things for ourselves but happens to help God, it would be different. For money, if we only give 10% of our raise to God, then we are 90% help ourselves and 10% helping God. For dating, if we only date people we have feeling for (or attracted to), which only if we have the perfect intuition for what is good qualities to God may we say that our desire is aligned with God. Even so, we still facing the problem that we choice such relationship not based on what we can give but what we can get. I agree that we have limited compacity to give to people. So if we are to make most of it for God, shouldn't we choose whom to help based on who I can help the most, instead of whom I am most closed to? If we choose someone based on their Godly spirituality, doesn't mean that they would need less help spiritually than other less spiritual person? For Mathew 5:46 says: "If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Do not even tax collectors do the same?"

Matthew 5:46
