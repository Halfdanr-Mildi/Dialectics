Haixiang: Psalm 23:23 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. Philippians 4:11 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. 12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. If we are to be content with what God has given us, should we still want and pursuit things in life: such as promotion, money, or romantic relationships?

JT: I think we should pursue those things if they glorify God.  With money and stuff, if you want to make more money to give to God or to take care of your family, then that's cool because you are trying to do things God wants you to do.  If you just want more money to use on yourself, then that's not good.  Same with romantic relationships.  If you think that relationship will help you glorify God more, then by all means you should do it.  Also, some people want to get married so they can have kids.  God also calls people to do that, so that seems fine (also, Paul gives the case about purity too.  Getting married can be a way to help with purity).  

Haixiang: So those things can be glorify to God but given that we have not given explicit command to (for example, God does not tell us to make a lot of money, or to date people we like), but didn't it glorifies God more if we instead use our time and energy to do things God has commanded us? To serve the poor, to love everyone (not just the ones we like or the ones that loves us Mathew 5:46). Why should we make those things that we desire as priority in our life over other things God calls us to do?

JT: Those things shouldn't come at the cost of other things God asks us to do.  Like we shouldn't steal to get money for the church, but in our doing what God wants, we will find things we need to do that.  There's nothing wrong with trying to get those things.  If the church needed money for something important and I could get a job to make money for that, why not?  God also gives us many commands that are not explicit.  If we can't do stuff he doesn't explicitly tell us to do, we can't do hardly anything.  Even loving people.  It doesn't say what exactly we should do to love people, but we still have to find ways to do it.
