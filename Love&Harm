Note: CS Lewis's essay "the humanitarian theory of punishment" has touched similar concept. I would recommand reading it.

Haixiang: Sometimes we face the problem that to love someone, we will have to harm them. In this discussion, I will assume that we are not consequentialists, i.e., that we do not judge the good or evil of an action simply based on its outcome. But then the question is, under what circumstances is it good to harm some?
