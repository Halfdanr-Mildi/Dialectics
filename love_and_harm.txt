Note: CS Lewis's essay "the humanitarian theory of punishment" has touched similar concept. I would recommand reading it. (JT: Is there a link for that somewhere?  I think we should try to provide sources for stuff if we can.  That way this is a complete place for everything)

Haixiang: Sometimes we face the problem that to love someone, we will have to harm them. In this discussion, I will assume that we are not consequentialists, i.e., that we do not judge the good or evil of an action simply based on its outcome. But then the question is, under what circumstances is it good to harm some?

JT: Depends what you mean by harm..  I think what you mean is a short-term harm for a longer-term help.  Is that right?  An example of where it would be good to do that is punishing a kid for doing something wrong, or not giving someone something that you think will harm them when they want it.  More generally, I'd say I think you should do that anytime you think the short-term harm will give them some long-term spiritual growth.

Haixiang: When I said harm, I meant bring negative effect to someone. It could be short term or long term. But given that our emotion is usually short term response. Let's restrict the conversation to short term. Now, let's consider, I honestly think lottery can make a lot of money, To help people I started a investment foundation for the poor, and collect money from them, and promised them that when we win the lottery the pot will be split based on contribution. I made a honest promise and is going to keep it when we win the lottery. Is what I am doing good?
